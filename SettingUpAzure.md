# Setting up Azure

The process for setting up Azure can be tricky if not followed carefully. There are many pitfalls where a wrong selection will
cause the application not to start correctly. Typically, if the application starts correctly it is going to work right and any
issues you have will be in your code.

This guide has setup and troubleshooting information for getting an Azure App Service and Azure SQL database to work well
together. We also use a Static Web App, but those are typically simple to set up.

The following steps are a fast way to get it going, and allow the steps to be done in a logical order. This is not the only way.
